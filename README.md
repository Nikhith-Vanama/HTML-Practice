# HTML-Practice
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web.  
It defines the structure of web pages using elements like headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more.  
HTML works alongside CSS and JavaScript to build visually styled and interactive websites.  
Browsers interpret HTML code to render content for users.  
It's the foundational technology for all web development.
